GoLang general utility libraries for supporting GoLanguage program development, and code write acceleration. 

Any of package is extremely and exhaustively tested, and ready for use. Into any package you can find details about provided features, types and utilities


Packages :

* [common](/hellgate75/general_utils/common) - Package that contains data types, measures and dt conversions
* [config](/hellgate75/general_utils/config) - Package that contains GoLang (*.a) database utilities
* [generics](/hellgate75/general_utils/generics) - Package that contains experimental type generalization utilities
* [errors](/hellgate75/general_utils/errors) - Package that contains error and custom errors features and utilities
* [log](/hellgate75/general_utils/log) - Package that contains custom and extensive logger engine features and utilities
* [net](/hellgate75/general_utils/net) - Package that contains networking utilities, exposing sub packages features
* [net/common](/hellgate75/general_utils/net/common) - Package that contains networking common types, features and utilities
* [net/web](/hellgate75/general_utils/net/web) - Package that contains Web Server features
* [parser](/hellgate75/general_utils/parser) - Package that contains entity parsing utilities in multiple formats with standard interfaces
* [parser/logger](/hellgate75/general_utils/parser/logger) - Package that contains logger parser features
* [process](/hellgate75/general_utils/process) - Package that contains process, workflows and semaphores for process management
* [streams](/hellgate75/general_utils/streams) - Package that contains Brokers, Events, Consumers, Channel managers, and more streaming features, types and utilities
* [utils](/hellgate75/general_utils/utils) - Package that contains basic types utilities (arrays, files, etc..)

All packages are internal logger ready, integrated and full working.

The idea is to create a collection of undefined basic features, used as accelerator for GoLanguage software development and product integration
